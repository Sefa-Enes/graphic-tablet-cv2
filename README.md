Do you need a graphic tablet but you only have a webcam and nothing else? Now you can use this app and get the performance of a graphic tablet with only colors.
You will see this windows when you start main.py:

You have to set a main color for app to follow. But it won't draw yet. You will need a side color for drawing. If side color is detected then the app will trace and draw the main color that it follows.
Config 1 for main color, Config 2 for side color.

As you see in the image above I picked blue and green colors. For main color I choose green:

And for side color I chose blue

DON'T FORGET TO SAVE. App will start with last saved colors so you dont need to set color every time.
Now if everything done properly when both colors detected app will draw,
